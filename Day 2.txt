Permissions in Linux

Types:
	U - User
	G - Group
	O - Other
ascii Linux is shown by . (security Linux) - it means ascii Linux is enabled on this machine

ll -d devops.txt 
Shows the file

ll -d /data/

r- read  or   4
w- write or   2
x- execute or 1
which is total of 7

To change file ownership
chown permission <resource name>
chown jk /salesdata/

To change group ownership
chgrp permission <resource name>
ex : chgrp sales/salesdata/

To change file permissions
chmod 777 /data
first 7 - user second 7- group third 7-other

or,
chmod u+rwx g+rwx o-rwx /data

Max permission on folder - 777
Max permission on file - 666

sticky bit permission is inherited on the folder, so that user can read others data but cannot delete it
Sticky bit is always applied to others
chmod o+t /salesdata/

To move : mv zain.txt /salesdata/

SG id bit is at group level so that we can modify(write) files in the group
chmod g+s /salesdata/
drwxrws--T.
It gets executed on the new files created after this

To append in a file
cat >> devops.txt

If we exit we become SUDO user as Aws - ec2-user@server
SUDO user has some special command rights - 
Sudo user's name starts with sudo

--
whereis "command" : tells where the source of command is

cd/var/log/ -to see the log directory
ll

fdisk -l :- to show storage and partition

jacksparrow     ALL=(ALL)       /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/bin/passwd, !/usr/sbin/passwd root


DAEMON

uname -r
uname -a
rpmquery httpd - to know if the package is installed or not

vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

systemctl status httpd - to know about the service

systemctl start httpd - to start the service

reboot from aws instance and again httpd stops

systemctl enable httpd

cd /var/www/html/ -: to move to html folder
echo "this is my html file" > index.html

apache by default runs on port 80 so allow port 80 in aws security group inbound rules

vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  -- to edit or config


default document 

systemctl reload-or-restart httpd.service (mostly to be reused as machine checks reload or restart is required and does accordingly to reflect new changes)

systemctl stop httpd (to stop a service)
systemctl disable httpd ( to permanently disable a service )

systemctl mask httpd ( to keep the service away from getting started or enabled)

systemctl unmask httpd
